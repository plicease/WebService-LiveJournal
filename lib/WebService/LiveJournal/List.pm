# ABSTRACT: (Deprecated) List base class for WebService::LiveJournal
# VERSION

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<NOTE>: This distribution is deprecated.  It uses the outmoded XML-RPC protocol.
LiveJournal has also been compromised.  I recommend using DreamWidth instead
(L<https://www.dreamwidth.org/>) which is in keeping with the original philosophy
LiveJournal regarding advertising.

This class is used as the base class for a number of
list classes included with the L<WebService::LiveJournal>
distribution.  You shouldn't need to interact with it
directly.
